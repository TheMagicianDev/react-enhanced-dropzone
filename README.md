Wrapper around `ReactDropZone` component. That does bring a large list of enhancement and features list.

- Add file name rename (in the preview)
- Multiple (at once, or in parallel)
- Easy data append with each upload (that it work well in multiple files in one request, and parallel multiple requests)
- Add remove queued files from the drop zone!! in multiple mode!! (on hover, or just a visible handler (maybe just better ) !!! very important feature)
- Progress rendering with overlay animation
- [use dynamic functions (calculators)]
- Think about all cases scenario [Handle them elegantly]
- Add multiple files in one request support [a prop to specify it]
- Multiple support for one and multiple setup (one will allow only one file )
for multiple => set multiple strategies
- Support for xhr request params headers ....etc
